# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview

In this project I am assisting a friend, Robin, with a web scraping project aimed towards having a singular site for her to centralize data, news, and updates related to the Mission to Mars. Several different programs were used in order to reach a system that would allow her to collect this data at the click of a button. BeautifulSoup was used to parse and extract the data while MongoDB was used to store the data that was collected via the searches. Splinter was used to automate a web browser for Robin to access and view the data.
